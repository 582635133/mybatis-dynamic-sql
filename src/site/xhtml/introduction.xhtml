<h1>MyBatis Query By Example</h1>
<p>MyBatis Query By Example (QBE) is a small library focused on one thing - building dynamic SQL clauses for JDBC
(and MyBatis in particular).</p>
<p>MyBatis QBE will build the following types of SQL clauses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In support of DELETE and SELECT statements, the library will generate a WHERE clause</li>
  <li>In support of INSERT statements, the library will generate a field list and matching VALUES clause</li>
  <li>In support of UPDATE statements, the library will generate SET and WHERE clauses</li>
</ul>

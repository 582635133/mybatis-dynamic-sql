<h1>Why Does This Exist?</h1>
<p>MyBatis Query By Example (QBE) is a small library focused on one thing - building dynamic SQL clauses for JDBC
(and MyBatis in particular).</p>
<h2>The Motivation</h2>
<p>MyBatis Generator is a code generator for MyBatis.  Judging from the download statistics on Maven central,
Bintray, and the Eclipse marketplace it is widely used.  One of the strengths of MyBatis Generator is that
it builds a dynamic query capability (selectByExample, deleteByExample, updateByExample).  But the code
generated to enable this capability is not great code.  It is huge, it contains a lot of what looks like
copy/paste code, it is hard to understand, and hard to extend.  There are reasons why the code looks that way
- primarily because it was originally conceived for iBatis and doesn't take advantage of the capabilities of
MyBatis.</p>
<p>By far the worst thing about the MyBatis Generator code is that it is inflexible. Only a small class of
dynamic queries can be created with that code.  Anything beyond the most simple cases requires a deep dive
into boolean algebra.</p>
   
<p>So MyBatis QBE was originally conceived as a simple way to solve the problems with the code generated by MyBatis
Generator.  But we soon realized that this library can stand on it's own.  Yes it will work with the generator,
but we think it might have uses outside the generator as well.</p>
<p>MyBatis Generator will ultimately be updated to generate code that uses MyBatis QBE rather
than the current overly verbose code.  In doing so, the *ByExample methods will gain tremendous flexibility,
at the loss of backwards compatibility. We think it will be worth it!</p>
